Hello everyone, my name is Domingo Gutierrez Ramos, 
and I’m proud to be from Fremont High School JAG 9–10.

I’m running for president because I want our class 
to have a strong voice and real leadership.
I believe the best leaders are 
dependable, responsible, and honest 
:qualities I work to live by every day.

I’m from Guatemala, 
and I speak both English and Spanish.
which allows me to connect with and represent everyone.
I stay organized, and I make sure things get done.
and to the best of our interests.

If you vote for me,
you’re voting for someone who’s 
truthful, reliable, and ready to make this 
year enjoyable and open for everyone to 
express themselves.

JAG has helped me grow a lot this year 
and last year . Before, I often felt disconnected 
from teachers, friends, and even family. That kind of isolation can lead to anxiety and depression, but JAG helped me talk to people and express myself freely without fear of being judged. Like anyone, I still struggle, but I keep moving forward because in life nothing is ever still, your forever growing and experiencing new challenges. Im here to lend a hand and make everyone feel welcome — not just in JAG, but the entire district.

Music is also a huge part of my life
it inspires me to keep going. That’s why my poster 
is inspired by Kanye West’s 2004 album The College Dropout.
He reminds us that art can be meaningful, and that no one is
perfect, they can face struggles but above all else they rise above them.

Vote Domingo Gutierrez Ramos for president.
