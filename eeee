Hello Mr Champ,I know its the weekend but i have some questions about retakes and questions about my current grade, i try my best to stay awake during your class since its very early i don't focus my all into my assignments and often feel confused with the work. my question is, do you accept late work and retakes? i see a 0 on my grade, the Unknown Metals Lab. i don't recall the day we took this, but if its a formative assignment like writing and stuff could i get a new copy? i may have lost it or forgot to turn it in that day. i'll check and see if i have it, if i do ill give it to you on monday.
From Domingo.
