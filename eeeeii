Hello Mr. Champ,
I'm checking in about my current science grade before the quarter ends.
I see a 0/20 for the Unknown Metals Lab. I think I must have forgotten to turn it in. Could I get a copy to complete and submit it this week?
I wanted to ask about the possibility of retakes. Do you allow retakes or correction opportunities for any of the low scores on quizzes or major assignments, such as the 63%?
if you dont allow retakes for tests thats totally understandable, id like it if i can get more information from the Unknown metals lab, and potentially if i could retake it.
Thank you,
Domingo
